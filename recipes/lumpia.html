        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p><strong>Lumpia</strong> is a popular Filipino dish similar to spring rolls, filled with seasoned ground pork and vegetables, then wrapped and fried until golden and crispy. Thinner and longer than egg rolls, lumpia is often served as an appetizer with sweet chili sauce for dipping, though it can also be enjoyed as part of a meal.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1b ground pork</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 inch fresh ginger, minced</li>
            <li>1 small onion, minced</li>
            <li>1 medium carrot, minced</li>
            <li>½ cup thinly sliced green cabbage</li>
            <li>⅓ cup minced water chestnuts</li>
            <li>2 scallions, minced</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 tsp ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 tbsp light soy sauce</li>
            <li>tsp sesame oil</li>
            <li>30 lumpia wrappers</li>
            <li>frying oil</li>
            <li>sweet chili sauce</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat and cook the ground pork until no pink remains, about 5 minutes. Drain excess grease.</li>
            <li>Add garlic and ginger, cooking briefly until fragrant, then stir in onions, carrots, cabbage, water chestnuts, and scallions. Sauté for 2-3 minutes until tender. Season with salt, pepper, garlic powder, soy sauce, and sesame oil. Remove from heat and let cool.</li>
            <li>To assemble, place a wrapper on a clean surface in a diamond shape. Spoon about 2½ tbsps of filling near the bottom, shape into a strip, then fold the bottom over, tuck in the sides, and roll tightly. Seal the edge with a little water. Repeat until all filling is used.</li>
            <li>Heat about 1 inch of oil in a skillet to 350°F. Fry 4 lumpia at a time, seam side down, turning as needed, for 1-2 minutes per side until golden brown.</li>
            <li>Drain on paper towels and serve hot with sweet chili sauce.</li>
        </ol>
